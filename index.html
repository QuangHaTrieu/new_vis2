          <h2 style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tourism in Australia from 2001 to 2024</h2>
          <p style="font-size: 14px"> Australia’s tourism industry is one of the key
             economic drivers, contributing dramatically to the GDP and creating numerous
              jobs. These countries provide not only natural wonders but also cultural 
              experiences. The sector is recovering well after the COVID-19 period.
              Domestic Tourism accounts for the largest part of this industry, which
              means that most visitors are Australians.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size: 14px"> The area chart and the heatmap show that the number of
             trips to different states in Australia, in particular, and to the whole of 
             Australia, in general, has been increasing over time. The area chart clearly
              shows a significant drop around 2019 to 2022, caused by the covid and social 
              isolation. However, after COVID, domestic tourists started to revisit different
              places in Australia, it is demonstrated by the local upward trend from 2022 until now. 
         </p>

         <p style="font-size: 14px"> 
          The Donut chart illustrates that “Friends or relatives property” and “Hotels and similar”
          are always the most popular accommodation choices. While there is a more even distribution
          among different types of accommodation in regions, there is a distinctive difference between
          different accommodation types in capital cities such as Melbourne and Sydney.

                <p style="font-size: 14px">The map shows that most trips come to coastal regions, with the eastern and southern 
                  areas being the most popular destinations. In detail, among Australia’s states, Victoria and New South Wales
                   stand out as the most tourist attraction locations, reflecting the attractiveness of major cities like Melbourne
                    and Sydney. Coastal Queensland and a part of Western Australia also attract a moderate number of tourists, but 
                    it is less than in southeast regions. In contrast, as we move inland, central Australia and the Northern Territory
                     attract much fewer trips, reflecting these regions' unpopularity as domestic tourism destinations. .</p>

              <p style="font-size: 14px;">In 2024, most domestic tourists visit different regions in Australia to visit friends and relatives.
                The number of trips for this purpose varies significantly among various states. The parallel plot shows that the number of trips
                for this purpose is highest in New South Wales, followed by Victoria. On the contrary, Business trips consistently have the 
                lowest number among all regions, reflecting that the most common reasons for domestic travel are leisure and social. </p>
